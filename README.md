Hello there!

It's awesome to hear about the progress you've made with your Dictionary App using Java. 

Adding features like phonetic meaning, multiple definitions, synonyms, and antonyms enhances the user experience. It's also great that you're exploring RestFul APIs and experimenting with features like displaying images using the ChatGPT image generator.

Given the limited credits for the image generation feature, you've already accomplished quite a bit. If you'd like to share your GitHub link or specific parts of your code where you're seeking feedback or assistance, I'd be happy to take a look. Whether it's about optimizing code, enhancing features, or addressing any challenges you're facing, feel free to provide more details or ask specific questions!
